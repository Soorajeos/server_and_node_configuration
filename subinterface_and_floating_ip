ADDING SUBINTERFACE IN UBUTU 18.04


# Create a config file in /etc/network/interfaces.d with name 60-my-floating-ip.cfg

sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces.d/60-my-floating-ip.cfg

# Enter the following configuration to create a subinterface eth0:1

auto eth0:1    # name of the subinterface
 iface eth0:1 inet static
     address IP    # IP address. The floating ip can be added here   
     netmask 32    # netmask


# Save the config file and restart the network 

sudo service networking restart

# use ifconfig to confirm the subinterface is added



ADDING SUBINTERFACE IN UBUTU 20.04

# Ubuntu 18.04 uses files in /etc/network/interfaces.d as the configuration file for network.
# Ubuntu 20.04 uses netplan for controlling and modifying the networks.
# The default configuration file for netplan is located at /etc/netplan
# The default configuration file will look like this :-

# This file is generated from information provided by the datasource.  Changes
# to it will not persist across an instance reboot.  To disable cloud-init's
# network configuration capabilities, write a file
# /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg with the following:
# network: {config: disabled}
network:
    version: 2
    ethernets:
        eth0:
            addresses:
            - IPV6/64
            dhcp4: true
            gateway6: IPV6
            match:
                macaddress: MAC-ID
            set-name: eth0

# For adding the subinterface with netplan, we have to create the vlans and add it in /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml. The configuration will look like this

    vlans:            # Creating the vlan
        veth0:        # Name of subinterface
            id: 0
            link: eth0    # Main interface
            addresses: [IP/NETMASK]   # IP for subinterface/subnet mask. The floating ip can be added here.


 
THE FINAL CONFIGURATION FILE SHOULD LOOK LIKE THIS IN /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml :-

network:
    version: 2
    ethernets:
        eth0:
            addresses:
            - IPV6/64
            dhcp4: true
            gateway6: IPV6
            match:
                macaddress: MAC-ID
            set-name: eth0

    vlans:
        veth0:
            id: 0
            link: eth0
            addresses: [IP/NETMASK]


# After adding the vlans save the config file and apply the changes. This will create a subinterface veth0 


sudo netplan apply


# use ifconfig to confirm the subinterface is added
